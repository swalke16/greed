== Read Me

by Scott Walker

== Description

After finishing off the original Ruby Koans and the extra credit greed game project
I decided to continue my learning of Ruby by incrementally enhancing the greed game
with new and interesting features beyond the initial game requirements. Thus far
I have added the ability to:

1) Allow any number of human players to play the game interactively through the console.
2) Allow any number of computer players (*very* simple) to play the game against human or
   other computer players.
3) Output coloring on the console via the required Highline gem.
4) Probably some other stuff that I can't think of right now...

== Documentation

As a complete ruby n00b this is a learning project to me. I encourage anyone who would like
to, to please provide me feedback so that I can become a better ruby developer and a better
developer in general. 

I have done the best that I could from what I've learned thus far to organize the files into
the typical ruby project structure, naming conventions, etc...

== Examples

I have provided two rake tasks to go with this project.

1) rake play_console - plays the console game <-- Default rake task
2) rake spec - runs the included RSpec examples

== Future Enhancements

1) Create a rails UI on top of the game to learn rails.
